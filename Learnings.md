We have recorded a list of tips & tricks that we found while working with ChatGPT (for this repository/session).

We have also recorded times, when ChatGPT was not feeling good, maybe a bit confused, and we had roll our sleeves and step in!



- When you have a lot of prompts, ChatGPT gets pretty confused sometimes. Like we used in this session, it becomes necessary to structure your 'requests' more concisely to ChatGPT. But! you don't have to do it. You can always start a new session and redo your section - until you have what you wanted. We wanted to document our process of how we used ChatGPT in a single session, which is why we used trial and error to come up with the 'perfect prompts'. So feel free to do multiple attempts!

- Sometimes chatGPT does not carry out a command the way you hope it to - just press 'Regenerate'

- We experienced some technical difficulties regarding how the css was being written. More specifically we had duplicate class names and ids. No problem, we simple added an extra prompt and asked chatGPT to rewrite the css with '>' selector.

- For some prompts, the code was too long, that ChatGPT gave us a new button 'Continue generating'. Press this please! This means, ChatGPT is asking if you are happy with how the code (in the current prompt is, and if it is ok, can we continue to generate the rest of the code?)

- When you regenerate code in html, css, sometimes, chatGPT created a new class name or id for us  - for html and css, but not for javascript. Which meant that our javascript code did not work anymore. No worries, we pressed 'Regenerate' until new code was generated with changes in all html, css and js (javascript).
